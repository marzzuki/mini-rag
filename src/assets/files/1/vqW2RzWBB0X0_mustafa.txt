Cool, I found a bunch more detail about **Mustafa Marzouk** — here’s a fuller picture of who he is and what he does. If you want, I can put it in bullet-form or highlight stuff relevant to “animation / AI / Upwork” so it’s simpler.

| *An Enhanced Transformer-Based Approach with Meta-Ensemble Learning for Arabic Sentiment Analysis*                              | Published Sep-2023, at IEEE / MIUCC-23 | Combined transformer models + meta-ensemble learning to improve performance on Arabic sentiment analysis. Their result achieved **95.2% accuracy**, \~2% higher than previous best meta-ensemble deep-learning model. ([msa.edu.eg][2]) |
| *Enhancing Garment Sewing Employee Added Value Monitoring Using a Video-Based Spatio-Temporal Approach Through Computer Vision* | July 2024 (Conference)                 | Used video analysis (spatial + temporal features) to monitor sewing workers in garment industry. ([ResearchGate][3])                                                                                                                    |
| *Beyond Touch: A Comparative Study of Gesture and Tangible Interactions for Smart Tables Using Multi-Source Data*               | July 2024                              | Not super deep details in what I saw, but looks like comparing interaction modes for smart surfaces / tables. ([ResearchGate][1])                                                                                                       |

## Other Skills / Roles

* Freelancer / Animator using **Manim** (a mathematical animation framework) on Upwork. He does animations for math, technical and scientific concepts. ([Upwork][4])
* On LinkedIn, his profile lists roles like Full Stack Engineer, AI Researcher, Django Developer, etc. So he works both in research/academia and in more applied / software/engineering roles. ([LinkedIn][5])
* He’s been recognized (or finalist) in ECPC (not sure what that stands for, maybe a competition) per his LinkedIn. ([LinkedIn][5])

If you like, I can pull up his work portfolio (animations) or list of published papers with links. Do you want that?
